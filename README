This is the QtWayland module.

The QtWayland module consists of two parts:

Wayland platform plugin:
    Enables Qt applications to be run as Wayland clients.

QtCompositor API:
    Enables the creation of Wayland compositors using Qt and QtQuick.

By default only the Wayland platform plugin is built.  If you want to build the
experimental QtCompositor API then you need to set the qmake CONFIG variable to
include "wayland-compositor" when building the QtWayland module:

qmake CONFIG+=wayland-compositor
make

To build the QtWayland module you need the external dependencies:
xkbcommon 0.2.0 - http://xkbcommon.org/
wayland 1.1.0 - http://wayland.freedesktop.org/


We hang out at #qt-labs and #qt-lighthouse on freenode if you have any questions
